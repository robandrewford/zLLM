# xllm6 to xLLM Migration Checklist

This checklist helps ensure that all functionality from xllm6 is properly implemented in xLLM before removing the old code.

## Core Functionality Verification

- [ ] **Knowledge Base Construction**
  - [ ] Tokenization and text processing
  - [ ] Word pair association
  - [ ] Multi-token word handling
  - [ ] URL mapping
  - [ ] Category handling
  - [ ] Related topics handling
  - [ ] "See also" topics handling

- [ ] **Query Processing**
  - [ ] Basic keyword queries
  - [ ] Multi-token word queries
  - [ ] Relevance scoring
  - [ ] Result formatting

- [ ] **Data Tables**
  - [ ] Dictionary table
  - [ ] Embeddings table
  - [ ] Word hash table
  - [ ] Hash see table
  - [ ] Hash related table
  - [ ] Hash category table
  - [ ] N-grams table
  - [ ] Compressed tables

## NVIDIA MVP Backend Verification

- [ ] **Backend Tables**
  - [ ] Backend dictionary
  - [ ] Backend embeddings
  - [ ] Backend hash ID
  - [ ] Backend hash agents
  - [ ] Backend hash context tables
  - [ ] Backend ID mapping tables
  - [ ] Backend sorted n-grams

- [ ] **NVIDIA-Specific Query Processing**
  - [ ] Financial data queries
  - [ ] Product information queries
  - [ ] Technical specification queries
  - [ ] Performance metric queries

## Output Verification

- [ ] Run the verification script (`scripts/verify_xllm_vs_xllm6.py`)
- [ ] Verify that all test queries produce identical or equivalent results
- [ ] Verify that all data tables have the same structure and content
- [ ] Verify that all NVIDIA-specific queries produce identical or equivalent results
- [ ] Verify that all NVIDIA backend tables have the same structure and content

## Performance Verification

- [ ] Knowledge base construction time
- [ ] Query response time
- [ ] Memory usage
- [ ] NVIDIA-specific query performance

## Additional Features in xLLM

- [ ] Improved modularity and code organization
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Command-line interface improvements
- [ ] Support for multiple knowledge bases (standard and NVIDIA)

## Migration Steps

1. [ ] Run verification script to identify any discrepancies
2. [ ] Fix any issues in xLLM implementation
3. [ ] Re-run verification to confirm fixes
4. [ ] Create a backup of xllm6 code and data
5. [ ] Create a backup of NVIDIA MVP backend tables
6. [ ] Remove xllm6 code once all tests pass
7. [ ] Remove NVIDIA MVP backend tables once all tests pass

## Completion Criteria

The migration is considered complete when:

1. All core functionality tests pass
2. All NVIDIA MVP functionality tests pass
3. All output verification tests pass
4. Performance is equivalent or better
5. All additional features are implemented and tested
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the new system
